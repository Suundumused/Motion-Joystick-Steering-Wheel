Connection is made only by Wi-Fi, using the UDP protocol (with packet loss management) for low latency, the receiver in Windows creates a Virtual Joystick with the profile of the Xbox 360 controller where it receives packets from the smartphone connected to the same network.

- It is recommended to attach the smartphone to a mobile phone holder with a flexible arm on the table for greater stability. Most models are designed to take up as much screen space as possible.

- Accelerometer data passes through stabilization and smoothing filters before being delivered to the final axis input.
